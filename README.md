# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
#Introduction
Welcome to the "Machine Learning from Scratch" project! This project is created with the aim of helping me gain a deeper understanding of fundamental machine learning algorithms and how to implement them from scratch using Python.

# Algorithms
- **Bias - Variance Tradeoff**: In Machine Learning, this is an important concept, assessing the balance between the complexity of the model and its ability to generalize.
- **K-nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple classification and prediction algorithm based on finding the nearest points in feature space.
- **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model that predicts continuous values based on the linear relationship between input variables and the output variable.
- **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm using the logistic function to estimate the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class.
- **Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)**: A linear classifier used for binary classification tasks, learning weights through a simple iterative process.
- **Softmax Regression**: A generalization of logistic regression to handle multiple classes, providing probabilities for each class.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in feature space, maximizing the margin between classes.
